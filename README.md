0x11. C - printf()

# **A bit about the code**

The \_printf() function is used to produce formatted output to the standard output stream (stdout). It uses a format string to control how subsequent arguments are converted for output. The format string is made up of ordinary characters that are copied unchanged and conversion specifications that start with the % character. Conversion specifiers are used to specify the type of conversion to be applied, such as d for decimal notation, c for character, and s for strings. The \_printf() function uses several helper functions to handle different types of conversions and to validate the format string. Upon successful completion, the function returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings. If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
